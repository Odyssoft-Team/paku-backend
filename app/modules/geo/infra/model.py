"""Geo infrastructure models.

The Geo catalog is hardcoded (see `districts_data.py`), so there are no SQLAlchemy
models for districts.

NOTE: A previous version of the project had a `geo_districts` table managed by
Alembic. In early dev we removed that table and its FK dependencies.

# Intentionally left empty: no DB models for Geo catalog.
